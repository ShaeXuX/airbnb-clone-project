## API Security
Ensuring the security of backend APIs is crucial for protecting user data, securing transactions, and preventing unauthorized access. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project:

### 1. Authentication
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for verifying user identity.
- Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.
- Prevents unauthorized users from interacting with sensitive data.

üîí **Why it matters?** Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and ensures secure login sessions.

### 2. Authorization
- Implements **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict permissions.
- Ensures that users (guest, host, admin) can only perform allowed actions.
- Prevents unauthorized modifications to critical resources.

üîí **Why it matters?** Limits access to sensitive operations, such as payment processing and property management.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Uses **API rate limiting** to prevent excessive requests from a single source.
- Protects against **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks**.
- Ensures fair usage of server resources and prevents abuse.

üîí **Why it matters?** Prevents system overload, ensuring stable and reliable API performance.

### 4. Data Encryption
- Encrypts **sensitive data** like passwords and payment details using **AES-256**.
- Ensures secure transmission via **HTTPS/TLS**.
- Protects stored data using **hashing techniques**.

üîí **Why it matters?** Safeguards user privacy and ensures confidential information remains protected.

### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
- Filters **user inputs** to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Uses **parameterized queries** for database interactions.
- Validates data formats before processing requests.

üîí **Why it matters?** Prevents malicious attacks aimed at corrupting or stealing data.

### 6. Secure API Endpoints
- Uses **OAuth 2.0** for third-party API integrations.
- Implements **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** to manage requests from external domains.
- Logs and monitors API requests for security auditing.

üîí **Why it matters?** Ensures only trusted entities interact with API endpoints while tracking suspicious activity.

---
By integrating these security measures, the system ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of all API services. Continuous monitoring and updates help mitigate evolving security threats.



## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential for streamlining the development process, ensuring high-quality software releases, and reducing manual intervention. 

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software. It helps developers integrate code changes frequently, run automated tests, and deploy updates without manual intervention. This ensures a reliable and efficient workflow that minimizes bugs and downtime.

### Why CI/CD is Important for This Project?
- **Automated Testing:** Ensures new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Faster Deployment:** Reduces manual work and speeds up feature releases.
- **Consistent Builds:** Maintains uniformity across different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Rollback Mechanism:** Allows quick recovery if issues arise in a deployed version.

### Tools Used for CI/CD
We utilize various tools to implement and maintain the CI/CD pipeline:
- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì Automates workflows for testing, building, and deploying code.
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerizes applications to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Jenkins** ‚Äì Provides automated build and deployment pipelines.
- **Kubernetes** ‚Äì Manages and orchestrates containerized applications efficiently.
- **Terraform** ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deploying cloud resources.
